// EVERY SCREEN IS IN THE FIRST DOWNLOAD, on purpose. A screen's title, its

// never wait: a route that loaded its code on demand could only fill the gap with
// a skeleton of the whole page, and that is exactly what the screens must not do.
// What stays out of the download is what is heavy AND only part of a screen: the
// run's graph (React Flow) and the brand marks, which load inside their screens.

// Data stays fresh for 5s: moving between screens does not refetch what was
// just read, and a screen that comes back shows the old data while it renews.
